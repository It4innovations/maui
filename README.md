### Attention: This is only a fork of the Maui Scheduler with no changes applied by IT4Innovations.

We forked this project as the original repository (https://github.com/LabAdvComp/maui.git) went away in 2020. The source code of the Maui Scheduler (its simulator, to be precise) is needed for the [Maui-Simulation](https://github.com/It4innovations/Maui-Simulation) project.
Since the original source code vanished before we were able to fork, we forked from [https://github.com/mfagiani/maui](mfagiani/maui) which contains a similar enough soure base, using the master branch.
